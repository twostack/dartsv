/// ## Bitcoin Signed Messages
///
/// The *Bitcoin Signed Message* "standard" takes a novel approach in relying on our ability
/// to recover a Public Key from an ECDSA signature.
/// Once we have the public key recovered we can then generate a corresponding bitcoin
/// wallet Address and verify that an *address corresponds to a signature*.
///
/// Private Key (is used to generate) ---> Signature (is used to recover) --->  Public Key (is used to create) --->  Address
